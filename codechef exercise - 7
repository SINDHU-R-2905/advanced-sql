1.Combining tables with SQL
Ok - lets use the concept.

Write a query which does the following

Join the tables 'student' and 'course'
Uses 'Course_id' to match both the tables and output the joined table
Output all entries from the joined table

select 
s.St_id,
s.St_Name,
s.Department,
s.Course_id,
c.Course_id,
c.Course_Name,
c.Credits,
c.Prof_id
from student s
join course c
on s.Course_id = c.Course_id;
