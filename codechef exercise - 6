Write a query to group the dishes based on the price as:

High - If Price more than 18
Medium - If Price of the dishes is between 10 and 18
Low - If the price is less than 10.
The final output table should have the following 2 columns

the price group aliased as 'Pay_Category' as above
the count of the dishes falling in the respective category aliased as 'dish_count'
Expected output
┌──────────────┬────────────┐
│ Pay_Category │ Dish_count │
├──────────────┼────────────┤
│ High         │ 4          │
│ Low          │ 2          │
│ Medium       │ 7          │
└──────────────┴────────────┘
